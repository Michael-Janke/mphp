  "Algorithms": {
    "tree":
      "This algorithm trains a decision tree to run on the data and then extracts the genes that were most helpful in dividing the cancer types.",
    "norm":
      "This algorithm is a normalized version of feature selection. When computing feature scores, this algorithm accounts for differences between healthy and sick tissue in order to remove cell differences from the result.",
    "basic":
      "This feature selection algorithm computes a score for each feature and selects the features (genes) with the best scores.",
    "sfs":
      "The sequential forward selection greedily builds a set of features. The quality of features is measured with fitness functions, which account for the differences between sick and healthy tissue.",
    "ea":
      "This evolutionary algorithm returns the set of genes that best divides the cancer types. This algorithm normalizes for healthy tissue in order not to find gene differences of different cells."
  },
  "Parameters": {
    "k": "The number of features (genes) that are returned.",
    "n":
      "The number of features (genes) that are excluded from the calculation to increase performance.",
    "m":
      "The number of preselected features (genes) that are used for the calculation to increase performance.",
    "norm":
      "The normalization method used to reduce the impact of underlying differences in healthy tissue.",
    "fitness": "The fitness function used to evaluate the intermediate results."

  "Evaluation": {
    "F1Sick":
      "The F1 score for all sick tissues. This is the harmonic average of the precision and recall, 1 being the best value (perfect precision and recall) and the worst being 0.",
    "F1Healthy":
      "The F1 score for all healthy tissues. This is the harmonic average of the precision and recall, 1 being the best value (perfect precision and recall) and the worst being 0.",
    "CombinedFitness":
      "The combined fitness score of our evaluations. This is the average of the clustering (average sick silhouette score - average healthy silhouette score), classification (sick F1 score - healthy F1 score on a trained decision tree), and sick vs. healthy (average F1 score for each cancer classification) fitness score."
  },
  "GeneExpression": {
    "General":
      "In different cancer types, genes are differently expressed. This matrix shows which genes are over- and which are underexpressed compared to the healthy cells from the same region.",
    "TotalScores":
      "The calculated total scores that reflect how much a gene is already connected with cancer, according to our connected knowledge bases.",
    "GeneScoreExplanation":
      "We search for the gene in different databases and check whether it is already associated with cancer. If a gene is not found in one of the databases, we also check for coexpressed genes. This can result in two results being displayed in one cell (in case the coexpressed gene returned a positive result)."

  "General": {
    "Run":
      "Some algorithms have special requirements, resulting in the 'Run' button being disabled if those requirements are not met. Try adding more cancer or tissue types until the button is reenabled or switch to another algorithm.",
    "OneAgainstRestResult":
      "Because you selected the one against rest option, you can now switch between views for the selected cancer types to see all available results."
