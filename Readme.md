# Identifying Cluster Discriminant Features In Cancer Data

Repository for analysing gene expression data.

The goal is to identify genes which are differently expressed in healthy and unhealthy people and
which can be used to cluster cancer types into their categories. The current version is deployed at `http://vm-mpws2017hp1.eaalab.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/`.

A short documentation can be found [here](doc/index.md).
